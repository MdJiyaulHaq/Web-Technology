    <h3>This is Id and Classes Topic</h3>

    <!-- remember that id is unique. you cannot define id named dummyId in either(div,span,p,etc) -->

    <!-- but class is not unique . class with same name can be created in any of mentioned above -->
    <!-- id and classes can be defined in any (div, span, p , etc) -->

    <!-- defining id and classes in div -->

    <div id="dummyId" class="bg_color border style">
        hello this is a dummyy sentence to which these effects are applied.
    </div>

    <!-- you can call  class in span like This. type (span.className) and Emmet does its work. -->

    <span class="style">effects will be applied to this sentence.</span>

    <!-- you can call  id in span like This. type (span.idName) and Emmet does its work. -->

    <span id="dummyId">effects will be applied to this sentence.</span>

    <!-- to call id in paragraph (p.idName) Let Emmet do its work -->

    <p class="dummyId">effects will take place in this paragraph</p>

    <!-- to call class in paragraph (p.className) Let Emmet do its work -->

    <p class="style">effects will take place in this paragraph</p>

    <!-- this is how you can acess class in div (,className or div.className) Emmet will display as shown below -->

    <div class="border">hello this is a dummyy sentence to which these effects are applied.</div>

    <!-- this is how you can acess id in div (#idName or div.idName) Emmet will display as shown below -->
    <!-- since, id and classes are in this case defined in div, so we can call by both ways -->

    <div id="dummyId">hello this is a dummyy sentence to which these effects are applied.</div>

    <!-- if n number of class is to be called , type (.className like border*4) and Emmet does its work -->
