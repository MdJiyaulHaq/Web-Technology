// Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next generation JavaScript, today.
// It transforms modern JavaScript (ES6+) into a version compatible with older browsers or environments.
// Babel can be used to transpile ES6+ code into ES5, enabling the use of modern JavaScript features while maintaining compatibility.
// To use Babel, you typically need to install it via npm and configure it using a .babelrc file or babel.config.js.

// npm i babel-cli@6.26.0 babel-core@6.26.3 babel-preset-env@1.7.0 --save-dev

// In real projects we don't use babel-cli directly, instead we use it with build tools like Webpack or Gulp.
